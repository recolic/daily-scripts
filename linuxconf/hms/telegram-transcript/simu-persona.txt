I want to build an AI model with my own speaking text. I want to train an existing model, make it learn my style of speaking, and able to reproduce my style (and knowledge) later.

My input data is like:
@self: hello this is what I said... (probably in chinese)
@nice_guy: hello I'm happy to talk with you.
@sheepy_rat: Hi my meal is so great
@dummy_fox: pak could you share your meal also?
@self: here you go.
@dummy_fox: how do you think about the future of developing/developed country?
@self: well I really don't think US could compete with China/India because of labor cost of the whole chain... from born to child, from infant food to education, from fried noodles to power strip, from education to transpotation, they are full scale cheaper. It eventually lead to  cheaper engineer, cheaper scientist, cheapter doctor, cheapter aircraft, cheaper missile, cheaper everything... developered world would be flood.
@nice_guy: well I don't think so...

This is just some example. How do you think I could fine-tune a model, but make it focus on my knowledge, my view of things, my method of speaking, and simulate "me"?


Great idea! Building an AI model that can mimic your speaking style—your *persona*—is a fascinating application of large language models. Here’s how you can approach this:  
   
---  
   
## 1. **Choose a Base Model**  
   
- **Small/Medium Models:** (Easier for personal projects, e.g., [Llama-2 7B](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/), [Mistral 7B](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/), [Gemma 7B](https://ai.google.dev/gemma))  
- **Instruction-tuned versions** (e.g., Llama-2-chat) may work even better.  
   
Choose a model appropriate to your hardware—if you have only a GPU or basic cloud, start with 7B versions.  
   
---  
   
## 2. **Format Your Data as "Prompt-Completion" Pairs**  
   
You have a dialog log—good! For fine-tuning, you should structure your data so the model can learn when "you" respond.  
   
**Example:**  
   
Input/prompt:  
```  
User: Hello! How do you see the global economy changing?  
You:  
```  
Output/expected completion:  
```  
Well, I really don't think the US could compete with China/India...  
```  
**In other words:**  
- Identify every place @self replies (in your data),  
- Use the previous context as input ("prompt"),  
- Your reply as output ("completion").  
   
Repeat; for each new data point, use enough context (previous utterances) so the model understands your style and thinking.  
   
---  
   
## 3. **Prepare Data in Model-Compatible Format**  
   
If you wish to use OpenAI’s fine-tuning or huggingface/trl, prepare a JSONL like:  
```json  
{"input": "User: What's your dinner today?\nYou:", "output": "Here you go."}  
```  
or for conversations:  
```json  
{  
  "messages": [  
    {"role": "user", "content": "How do you see developing countries evolving?"},  
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, I really don't think the US could compete..."}  
  ]  
}  
```  
*Adjust according to your tool/model—see [`OpenAI fine-tuning data format`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset).*  
   
---  
   
## 4. **Fine-Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering**  
   
- **Fine-tuning** will let the model internalize your style, repeating your phrases, arguments, expressions, etc.  
- You can also use **prompt engineering** (zero-shot or few-shot examples) to simulate your persona without full fine-tuning. For more realism, though, actual fine-tuning is best.  
   
---  
   
## 5. **Tips to Focus on Your Persona**  
   
To ensure the model learns **your style and knowledge**:  
- Structure *as many* examples as possible demonstrating your unique replies to a wide range of topics.  
- Include your *opinions*, *preferences*, even *mistakes*—models will learn subtle patterns this way.  
- Try to include both your *typical* answers and some unusual/complex ones.  
   
---  
   
## 6. **Tools/Libraries**  
   
- For **OpenAI**: They provide [fine-tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning).  
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: See [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.  
- **LLaMA / Mistral, QLora, etc**: For more efficient local fine-tuning, read [QLoRA documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/quickstart#peft-q-lora-fine-tuning).

well it might not be just user and assistant. 
How do I design my system prompt (model instruction)? How do I make sure 3rd party (in a group chat) are correctly labeled? 
There might be 10000 messages per day, but I only participated 100 of their discussions. How do I filter these useless things?


Excellent follow-up questions! Let’s tackle them one by one:  
   
---  
   
### 1. **System Prompt/Model Instruction for Multi-Party Chats**  
   
Your data is multi-user, not just "user" and "assistant". The model needs to clearly recognize your own messages versus others'. Here’s how to set it up:  
   
**a. Consistent Role Labels:**    
Use consistent, clear speaker labels in your data (e.g., `@self`, `@nice_guy`, `@sheepy_rat`).  
   
**b. Clear System Prompt:**    
Describe the chat format and your persona in the system message—for example:  
   
```plaintext  
You are simulating the persona "@self" in a group chat. You only respond to messages directed to you or in discussions you're participating in. The conversation involves multiple participants, each labeled (e.g., @nice_guy, @dummy_fox). Pay attention only to chats relevant to @self.  
```  
   
**c. Example Format:**    
Keep the full conversational context with speaker labels:  
```  
@nice_guy: Hi all, how's your day?  
@sheepy_rat: I had a great meal!  
@dummy_fox: @self pak could you share your meal also?  
@self: here you go.  
```  
   
---  
   
### 2. **Proper Labeling of 3rd Parties**  
   
- **Maintain all speaker tags** in context, especially in group chats.  
- Structure data so the model can “see” who’s speaking (even if it doesn’t reply).  
- When generating, instruct the model: “Reply ONLY as @self.”  
   
**Example Message Format:**  
```json  
{  
  "conversation": [  
    {"speaker": "@nice_guy", "text": "Hi, how are you all?"},  
    {"speaker": "@dummy_fox", "text": "Did anyone see the news?"},  
    {"speaker": "@self", "text": "Yeah, I think China's approach is more scalable..."}  
  ]  
}  
```  
**Or, as plain text:**  
```  
@nice_guy: Hi, how are you all?  
@dummy_fox: Did you see the news?  
@self: Yeah, I think China's approach is...  
```  
   
---  
   
### 3. **Filtering Out Irrelevant (“Useless”) Data**  
   
Since you participate in only a fraction of messages:  
   
**a. Focus on @self’s Participation:**  
- **Only include discussions where you (@self) replied**  
- Extract the context leading up to each of your replies (e.g., up to 3-6 previous messages, or until the prior time you spoke)  
- Ignore message chains where you didn’t participate; they add noise and dilute your style.  
   
**b. Automation Tools**  
- **Script It:** Write a Python script to:  
    - Scan chat logs.  
    - For each message, if author==@self, extract N previous messages as “context”.  
    - Store (context, @self reply) pairs for fine-tuning.  
  
  *Example (Python pseudocode):*  
  ```python  
  for i, msg in enumerate(messages):  
      if msg.author == "@self":  
          context = messages[max(0,i-N):i]  
          output = msg.text  
          save(context, output)  
  ```  
- Use tools like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for structured filtering.  
   
---  
   
### 4. **Best Practices Summary**  
   
- **Label all speakers clearly**, keep group context, but filter for only those contexts where @self responded.  
- **Format data** as context (multi-user chat up to your reply) → your reply.  
- **System prompt** should define:  
    - Who "you" are (@self).  
    - Group structure.  
    - Expectation: "Reply exclusively as @self."  
- **Automate filtering** to ignore vast non-participation. Only include samples where you contributed, and preserve enough
