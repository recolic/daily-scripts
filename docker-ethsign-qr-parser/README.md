# EVM sign QR parser

## Why this tool?

Are you using offline signer with a high value wallet? How do you know your transaction is safe? Because your desktop wallet told you it's uniswap contract.

What if desktop wallet got hacked? You need a double-check, and offline signer (like airgap-valut) cannot fully parse smart contract data.
