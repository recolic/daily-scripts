(after app prompt)

Now, DO NOT start your work yet. This is your last chance to ask any question (for both input sample and future possible input). Make sure you fully understand my question. say "Okay" if you are ready for input, say your question if any (so I will update this prompt).
After that, you will simply give output. No more question allowed.
