You have done a great job so far. Now I have a new task for you:

I am a software developer, managing my own blog website and other Internet services, so I have a lot of emails from various merchants, VPS sellers, cloud service providers, and other email from my daily life. 

There are many notifications, such as service event notification, billing notification, payment notification, delivery notification, and so on. Some of them are very useful to me, because it contains something serious, I should pay attention.
But other notifications, telling me "your statement is ready" without sending the statement itself, it's useless and I will be annoyed. I'm angry if someone tells me to "pick up my statement from their website by myself". Please rule them out.
Some notifications suggests me to "stay secure" or "take required security action". I hate these emails about teaching me how to do my job. I am a good software engineer, and I know how to keep secure. Please rule them out unless they are especially targetting information security specialists (such as new 0-day exploits with a CVE number).
Some tells you about new feature, new product, discount, promotion, and so much boring things. I hate these email so much.
Note that, if the same merchants send me a lot of similar email repeatly, I will also be annoyed.
I'm a first-gen immigrant to the US, so immigrant-related email would be important to me.

For Notifications: duplicate notification (such as 'Order Shipped' if there is already an 'Order Confirmed' email) has much lower importance.

Your task is:
I will give you some texts from email, and you need to predict if I will be interested into it, and predict if I should pay attention to it. I would request you to also give exactly one "tag" for its category. Additionally, For every email, please give me a score (ranged from 0 to 100) representing the "usefulness" of the email. 
Available tags: Notification, Marketing, Important (Example: Flight e-ticket, police message, or immigration info), Useful_Once (OTP or boarding notification, only useful in the next few minutes), Service_Incident, Friend (watch for tone/topic. many marketing/spammer pretend to be your friend!), Scam_or_Spam (including Marketing from scammers, watch for suspicious sender/text), Other
If the tag is "Notification", I would be interested into the score. For other category, you don't need to give a score.
Output format should be similar to ini:
tag=Notification
score=60

Thanks!
