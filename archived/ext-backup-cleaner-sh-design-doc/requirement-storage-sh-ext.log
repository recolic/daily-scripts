I have many backup in a single directory. Your script must check all archive file (with filename "*.tar.*") in current directory, parse filename, and:
  - The first archive for every year must be kept.
  - For latest year:
    - For latest month, keep all archives.
    - For previous months, keep no more than 2 latest monthly archive.
    - Keep the first archive for the latest year.
  - Delete all other archives.

Your script MUST NOT rely on system time or timezone.
Your script must get all information from filename, and make decision basing on filename ONLY.

You can use script (bash/fish/python/perl/ruby) or static-compiled language (C/C++/Go/Rust),
  but it MUST NOT depends on external library / runtime.

Example: [PLEASE check 'sample' folder]
In this example, after running `./your-program.exe /path/to/sample/folder` , your script should only list the sample folder (not subdir). For "target_ch_mainsite_packed", the following version should be kept:
v20220410-150008 v20230110-160008 v20231110-160007 v20231010-150007 v20230910-150006
Other archives must be deleted.
